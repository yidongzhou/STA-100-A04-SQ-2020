# STA 100 A04 SQ 2020

Welcome to STA 100 A04! Here you can find all discussion materials in this course. Also, I have included some other meterials for your reference.

If you want to have a deeper understanding about R programming, the following reference may be useful.

- Kabacoff, Robert I. R in Action. manning, 2010.
- Matloff, Norman. The art of R programming: A tour of statistical software design. No Starch Press, 2011.
- Wickham, Hadley, and Garrett Grolemund. R for data science: import, tidy, transform, visualize, and model data. " O'Reilly Media, Inc.", 2016.

Also, the following online learning resources are very handy and helpful.

- Online learning website: [DataCamp](https://www.datacamp.com/)
- Youtube video tutorialï¼› https://youtu.be/_V8eKsto3Ug
- Blog: https://www.r-bloggers.com/

Larning a new programming language is challenging, but also fulfilling. You are not required to remember all the commands in R, but some basic ones. Finally, Google is a perfect learning assistant. Try to make the best use of it.
